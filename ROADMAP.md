# VisaPilot: Launch Roadmap

This document translates the current MVP into a launch-ready product plan. Use it as the source of truth for engineering, content, and operations workstreams.

## âœ… MVP Pillars (Complete)

- **Flight search & booking:** Duffel integration delivers full search â†’ itinerary review â†’ booking with the $75 VisaPilot markup.
- **Study package payments:** Stripe Checkout is live for tiers and add-ons.
- **AI tools:** Consultation summaries, document checklists, and the AI course finder are functioning.
- **Appointment booking (v1):** Users can request consultations and the system persists them to the server-managed JSON store.

## ðŸš€ Launch Blockers (High Priority)

1. **Migrate appointments to a managed database**
   - [ ] Replace the JSON file with Firestore (or another persistent store).
   - [ ] Update admin pages to read/write from the database.
   - [ ] Introduce status management (new / confirmed / completed / cancelled).
2. **Secure the admin experience**
   - [ ] Choose an auth provider (Firebase Auth, NextAuth.js, Clerk, etc.).
   - [ ] Protect every route and API endpoint under `/admin`.
   - [ ] Add role-based access for future staff users.
3. **Automate transactional email**
   - [ ] Send confirmation emails to students and admins for bookings and purchases.
   - [ ] Template notifications for cancellations or reschedules.
   - [ ] Evaluate reminder emails (24 hours before consultation).
4. **Replace placeholder assets & copy**
   - [ ] Swap out stock/placeholder imagery across marketing and admin pages.
   - [ ] Refresh admin dashboard stats and labels with real data descriptions.
   - [ ] Confirm policy pages and links point to final legal content.
5. **Final QA & deployment**
   - [ ] Execute end-to-end smoke tests for every flow (booking, payments, AI tools, travel search).
   - [ ] Provision production hosting (Vercel + Fly.io/Render) and migrate environment variables.
   - [ ] Configure monitoring, analytics, and error reporting.
